Create areas or locations and organize them as hierarchical tags. 

A location is shown as a shape on the map when selected. Initially each location is represented as a square or circle and can be changed to a rectangle or ellipse by adjusting the shape's width and/or height.

A location can also be created from an OpenStreetMap region (city/country) polygon. To achieve this, first make sure the _max polygon points_ parameter is large enough (some country polygons use more than 150,000 points). Then select the desired location in the [find location](./find-location.md) module. When the corresponding region shape is displayed, a polygon symbol becomes available in the "shape" control (see below). Select it to create the new location.

Each location is stored as tag entry under the geotagging collection in the [collections](../shared/collections.md) module. The pipe “|” character can be used to insert a new level (a group of locations).

# module controls

shape
: Select the circle or rectangle symbol to choose the default shape for new locations. A polygon symbol is available when a shape is displayed by the [find location](./find-location.md) module.

new location / new sub-location
: When no location is selected you can use the _new location_ button to create a location at root level. When a location is selected use the _new sub-location_ button to create a sub-location within the selected location.

show all
: Show or hide all locations that lie within the visible area of the current map.

## actions on the locations list
