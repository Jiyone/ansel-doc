Set a session jobcode to allow the creation of a new film roll.

A session is a sequence of exposures taken in tethering mode and placed into a single film roll. A new session means the creation of a new film roll.

The session module allows you to set a jobcode, which can be used to create your new film roll. See [preferences > import > session options](../../../preferences-settings/import.md) for details about how to create new film rolls using the `$(JOBCODE)` variable in the session module.
