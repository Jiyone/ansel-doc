This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when Ansel's internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export.

Although not an inherent problem in any of Ansel's modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the [_vignetting_](./vignetting.md) or [_graduated density_](./graduated-density.md) modules. This is especially relevant for images with extended homogeneous areas such as cloudless sky. Also watch out for banding artifacts when using a gradient [drawn mask](../../darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/drawn).

Viewing an image dithered into a very low bit depth from some distance (e.g. “Floyd-Steinberg 1-bit b&w”) will give the impression of a homogeneous grayscale image. Ansel attempts to mimic this impression when rendering zoomed-out images in the center view, the navigation window and thumbnails. This is accomplished by dithering those images into a higher number of grayscale levels. Note that, as a consequence, the [scopes](../utility-modules/shared/scopes.md) module -- the data for which is derived from the navigation window -- will show this increased number of levels and is therefore not a full match to the output image.

# module controls

method
: Choose the dithering method to use.

: _Floyd-Steinberg_: Systematically distribute quantization errors over neighboring pixels. This method can be selected with some typical output bit depths. Alternatively, you can select _Floyd-Steinberg auto_, which automatically adapts to the desired output format.

: _random dithering_: This method just adds some level of randomness to break sharp tonal value bands.

damping ("random" method only)
: Controls the level of added random noise expressed as a damping factor in a 10*log 2 basis. A value of -80 is a good fit for 8-bit output formats; -160 for 16-bit output.
