Automatically detect and eliminate hot pixels. 

Hot pixels are pixels which have failed to record a light level correctly. Detected hot pixels are replaced by an average of their neighbors.

# module controls

threshold
: How strong a pixel's value needs to deviate from that of its neighbors to be regarded as a hot pixel.

strength
: The blending strength of the hot pixels with their surrounding.

detect by 3 neighbours
: Extend the detection of hot pixels -- regard a pixel as hot if a minimum of only three (instead of four) neighbor pixels deviate by more than the threshold level.

mark fixed pixels
: Visually mark the corrected pixels on the image and display a count of hot pixels that have been fixed.
