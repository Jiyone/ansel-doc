This documentation is derived from [darktable 4.0 user manual](https://github.com/darktable-org/dtdocs.git) and further developed under the [Ansel project](https://github.com/aurelienpierreeng/ansel-doc), where comments, suggestions and corrections can be made. It is released under the [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license.

[Darkroom modules](./views/darkroom/_index.md) that have been deprecated in either Ansel or darktable 4.0 are not documented here and can be found on [darktable user manual](https://docs.darktable.org).

The goal of this documentation is to explain the effect and use cases of the features and settings existing in the software. The opposite approach, explaining what features are useful to achieve a certain goal, is provided in the [workflows](../workflows/_index.md) section.
