This menu provides an overview of the [presets](../darkroom/processing-modules/presets.md) that are defined for Ansel's modules, and allows you to modify some of their properties.

Pre-defined presets (those that are included by default within Ansel) are shown with a lock symbol. Their properties cannot be changed.

User-defined presets can be imported from exported `.dtpreset` files using the "import" button at the bottom of the screen. You can export _all_ user-defined presets to a single directory using the "export" button.

Delete a user-defined preset by selecting it and pressing the Delete key.

Edit a user-defined preset's properties by selecting it and pressing Enter or double-clicking. This will open a dialog that allows the preset to be edited, exported to an external `.dtpreset` file or deleted.

See the [creating and editing presets](../darkroom/processing-modules/presets.md#creating-and-editing-presets) section for more information about the other properties that can be edited in this dialog.
