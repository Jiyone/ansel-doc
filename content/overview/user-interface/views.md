The functionality in Ansel is separated into six different views:

[lighttable](../../lighttable/_index.md)
: Manage images and collections.

[darkroom](../../darkroom/_index.md)
: Develop a single image.

[map](../../map/_index.md)
: Show geo-tagged images on a map and manually geo-tag new images.

[print](../../print/_index.md)
: Send images to a printer.

[slideshow](../../slideshow/_index.md)
: Display images as a slideshow, processing them on-the-fly.

[tethering](../../tethering/_index.md)
: Remotely capture and save images taken with a connected camera.

You can switch between views by clicking the view name at the top of the right-hand panel (the currently active view is highlighted) or by using one of the following keyboard shortcuts:

 - `L` switches to lighttable
 - `D` switches to darkroom
 - `M` switches to map
 - `P` switches to print
 - `S` switches to slideshow
 - `T` switches to tethering
