Highlight areas of the image that may exhibit gamut clipping.

Click the ![gamut-icon](gamut-icon.jpg) are mutually exclusive modes.

Right-click on the icon to open a dialog with configuration parameters -- these are the same as for the [soft proof](./soft-proof.md) option.

You might also like to consider using the [clipping warning](./clipping.md), which also provides under- and over-exposure warnings as well as a gamut check similar to that offered by this module.
