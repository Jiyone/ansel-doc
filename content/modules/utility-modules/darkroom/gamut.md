Highlight areas of the image that may exhibit gamut clipping.

Click the ![gamut-icon](gamut-icon.png#icon) icon to activate the gamut check display mode for your image. This function highlights, in cyan, all pixels that are out of gamut with respect to the selected softproof profile. You can also activate gamut check with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+G. A message “gamut check” on the bottom left of your image tells you that you are in gamut check display mode. Gamut check and [soft proof](./soft-proof) are mutually exclusive modes.

Right-click on the icon to open a dialog with configuration parameters -- these are the same as for the [soft proof](./soft-proof.md) option.

You might also like to consider using the [clipping warning](./clipping.md), which also provides under- and over-exposure warnings as well as a gamut check similar to that offered by this module.
