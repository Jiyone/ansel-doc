"mask opacity\n"
": The strength of the module's effect is determined by the mask's local opacity. Feathering and blurring the mask may reduce the opacity of the original mask. The “mask opacity” slider allows you to readjust the mask opacity to compensate. If the mask opacity is decreased (negative slider values) less opaque parts are affected more strongly. Conversely, if the mask opacity is increased (positive slider values) more opaque parts are affected more strongly. As a consequence, completely opaque portions of the mask always remain opaque and completely transparent portions always remain transparent. This is to ensure that regions that have been fully excluded from or included in a module's effect (by setting the mask's opacity to 0% or 100%) remain fully excluded or included.\n"

": That thing is coded by copy-pasting the display code, instead of writing reusable functions. It wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't completely misleading and actually broke the over-exposure alert (because, yes, it's used there too). Because the histogram is captured at the far end of the pipeline, in display color space, it might be already clipped to display gamut. Say you use Rec2020 space as the histogram profile, because it's the working space, what you see is RGB clipped to display space then rescaled to Rec2020, which means your clipping peak will not be at the far end of the graph, where you expect it. The result is highly misleading and voids the whole principle of a scope. That's just a whole pile of crap coded by people who have no idea of what a graphic pipeline is and hack small bits here and there because the concept of \"modules\" fooled them. They might be modular, but they still apply in sequence in the pipeline, so better check your inputs.\n"

The warning messages were supposed to tell users they are doing things not really intended by the designer (for example, using 2 different steps of white balance correction) and to ask them to double-check if that's really what they wanted. That backfired badly because users don't get the difference between an error and an alert, so even when instructed to use 2 white balances (for example, a custom-corrected raw WB), they would get afraid by the \"error\" and annoy me with questions. Given that this feature is clearly not helping anybody, and did not trigger the expected behaviour (that is, RTFM), there is no point in keeping it. The option to hide them is removed as well.\n"

"Importing from camera\n"
": darktable has a way to mount the camera file system (SD or CF memory cards) through USB, using the library GPhoto2. But the desktop environment is also be able to mount the camera as a local hard drive using PTP and/or MTP protocol, possibly also through Gphoto2. In that case, darktable and the OS may compete for access to the USB media, so you need to unmount it first from the OS to be able to open it from darktable. On Windows, you even need to install custom USB drivers to make it work with GPhoto2, but these drivers will prevent the camera to work with the OS until you completly remove and reset them. So this feature is completely removed, and Ansel loads memory cards as USB media through the OS mounts. To enable this, you may have to install Linux packages such as `libmtp`, `linuxptp`, `libptp`, `libgphoto2` and possibly `gphoto2`. For your desktop environnment, you may install `kio-mtp` and `kio-extras` on KDE or `gvfs-mtp` and `gvfs-gphoto2` on Gnome. In any case, you are advised to simply use an SD of CF card reader, it's cheap and prevents most issues that can arise from udev and cameras connected through USB.\n"

"Keyboard shortcuts\n"
": The great MIDI input thingy of 2021 broke basic functionality and user expectations : the numeric pad events did not listen to the state of `numlock` and were always recorded as `Home`, `End`, `PageDown` etc. Also, on AZERTY and BÉPO keyboards, the regular number keys are accessed through `Shift`. This broke the picture ratings because numbers from the numeric pad were not recorded as numbers, and the regular numbers did nothing. When reconfiguring the rating shortcuts with regular numbers, you would then see things like `Shift + &` on AZERTY or `Shift + \"` on BÉPO, instead of the expected `1`.\n"
": Then, to get the numpad numbers to work, you had to manually add them as alternative shortcuts. That's a backstep of more than 25 years regarding UI, all because the MIDI developer thought it was clever to disregard OS key mapping and handle it internally. This has been fixed in a way that gets the OS-decoded key (including modifiers like `Shift` and `numlock` when needed), and then remaps all numpad key strokes to regular key strokes, so the `Enter`, `*`, `/`, `Delete` and all the numeric keys will be treated equally no matter where they are input, without having to duplicate shortcuts for the numpad. It is crazy that this should be announced as a new feature in 2023 and is another proof that darktable development went south thanks to die-hard geeks.\n"

This might be _possible_ if your system uses swapping when all of its system memory is taken, but it could lead to system instability.

When tiling, Ansel frequently needs to transfer data between system and GPU memory. This option tells Ansel to use a special copy mode (pinned memory transfer), which can be faster, but can also require more memory on some devices. On other devices it might degrade performance. There is no safe general way to predict how this option will function on a given device so you will have to test it for yourself. If you have multiple devices, you can switch pinned memory transfer on or off on a \"per device\" basis by directly editing your Anselrc file.\n"

In order to actually process this image through a given module, Ansel needs at least two buffers (input and output) of this size, with more complex modules potentially requiring several additional buffers for intermediate data. Without further optimization, anything between 600MB and 3GB of memory might be required to store and process image data as the pixelpipe executes.

OpenCL offers a C99-like programming language with a strong focus on parallel computing.

This way applications can use OpenCL on different GPU architectures (even at the same time). All of the hardware “secrets” are hidden in this compiler and are normally not visible to the user (or the application). The compiled OpenCL code is loaded onto your GPU and -- with certain API calls -- it is ready to perform calculations for you.\n"

If you use _overwrite_ mode to paste history stack entries to images that haven't previously been opened in the darkroom then the next time that image is opened in the darkroom, automatic presets will be applied to the image.

When we try to convert from a larger color space to the final output color space, any values exceeding this maximum will be clamped to the maximum value, and any values below the minimum will be clamped to zero.

msgid "Color-grading is an important part of image editing. It can help to remove unwanted color casts and can also deliver a creative color twist that will add atmosphere to your images. In the days of film photography, most of the color ambiance was obtained with the film emulsion and the developing chemicals, with some color timing being performed under the enlarger with color heads. This consumed expensive resources and was mostly reserved for the cinema industry, where the job was performed by a colorist.\n"

msgid "In the digital age, where raw images look flat and even, color-grading assumes the same role that film emulsions did, by re-introducing color shifts for aesthetic purposes. It can also serve to harmonize the color palette of a series of images (which may have been shot under different conditions) to achieve a consistent global look. For this task, the [vectorscope](../utility-modules/shared/scopes.md#vectorscope) is also extremely useful.\n"

": This slider is only visible if you set the _precedence_ to “hue”. It allows you to select a preferred hue for replacement colors. This only has an effect if the preferred hue is actually present within the selected spatial and range distance of the target pixels (see above). A typical use case is repairing highlights on human skin in situations where diverging colors are in close proximity (e.g. textiles or hair with a luminance close that of to skin). Setting a hue preference on skin tones prevents these other colors from creeping in.\n"
